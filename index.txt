I belive in the power of process

I am a Designer & Researcher

After working post-graduation for two years in Savannah, I moved to Boston, MA to complete a Post-Baccalaureate program in Fine Art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University. Wanting to return to my Chicago roots, I made the move back to the windy city in the early Summer of 2023

In August of 2023, I enrolled in Northwestern Universityâ€™s UI/UX bootcamp, which began an exciting new career opportunity for this new chapter in my life. I am passionate about design, art, and people. and am excited to pursue a career as a UX/UI designer - where I can unite these passions to create a better and more beautiful world for everyone.
